# hello-world
starting up my git experience

I am a 20+ year VBA Developer. I am an autodidact and enjoy learning many things especially different programming languages. I am currently learning Smalltalk and Haskell. One of my favorite languages is Python. I study approximately 30 languages. I am committed to a new style of learning in which I take a task and do that task with each language. So far so good.
